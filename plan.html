        <h2>1. Define Program Goals and Objectives</h2>
        <p><strong>Primary Goal:</strong> Recycle old or unwanted books to create new ones, minimizing environmental
            impact.</p>
        <p><strong>Secondary Objectives:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce paper waste by reusing materials from old books.</li>
            <li>Educate the community on sustainable practices in publishing and book production.</li>
            <li>Promote reading and environmental consciousness by distributing recycled books to schools, libraries,
                and community centers.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Set Up a Collection System</h2>
        <p><strong>Collection Points:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Partner with local libraries, schools, bookstores, and community centers as drop-off locations.</li>
            <li>Place designated recycling bins in high-traffic areas, clearly labeled for “Book Recycling.”</li>
            <li>Arrange periodic collection drives at schools, universities, and offices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Acceptable Books:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Specify acceptable types of books for recycling (e.g., textbooks, novels, magazines) and make sure books
                are in good enough condition for paper to be reused.</li>
            <li>Note any exclusions, such as moldy or heavily damaged books that can’t be recycled effectively.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Implement Sorting and Processing Procedures</h2>
        <p><strong>Sorting:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Establish a sorting center where donated books can be evaluated.</li>
            <li>Sort books into categories: books that can be reused, books suitable for recycling, and books that
                cannot be recycled.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Processing Steps:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>De-binding:</strong> Remove covers, bindings, and any non-paper elements from the books.</li>
            <li><strong>Pulping:</strong> Transport the sorted paper to a recycling facility for pulping, where it will
                be turned into new paper.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Partner with Recycling Facilities and Paper Mills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Partnerships:</strong> Partner with eco-friendly paper mills that specialize in using
                recycled materials.</li>
            <li><strong>Quality Control:</strong> Ensure that the recycled paper meets the necessary standards for
                printing new books.</li>
