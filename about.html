        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            At Greenchapter, our mission is simple but powerful: to reduce the environmental impact of the paper industry
            by recycling old books and transforming them into new, sustainable paper products. We believe that every
            book has the potential for a second life, helping us preserve nature while fostering literacy and education.
        </p>

    <section class="about-story">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Greenchapter started with a single idea: to rethink how books could be reused, rather than discarded. As the
            paper industry continued to grow, so did its impact on forests, water resources, and ecosystems. Recognizing
            the need for change, a group of environmentalists and book lovers came together to form Greenchapter. Our goal
            was not only to reduce waste but to create a model for a sustainable future—where books could be
            continuously recycled and repurposed.
        </p>

    <section class="about-vision">
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            We envision a world where books no longer contribute to deforestation, waste, or pollution. By developing a
            closed-loop recycling process, Greenchapter aims to make the publishing and book production industry greener
            and more sustainable. We work to raise awareness of environmental issues within the publishing world and
            hope to inspire readers to choose recycled and eco-friendly options.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Environmental Impact</h2>
        <p>
            Every year, thousands of trees are cut down to produce paper for books, contributing to deforestation and
            habitat loss. Through our recycling efforts, Greenchapter saves trees, reduces waste, and lowers the carbon
            footprint of book production. We work with eco-friendly recycling plants and mills to create high-quality
            recycled paper, which is then used to print new books. This cycle helps decrease water usage, energy
            consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since our inception, Greenchapter has saved hundreds of trees and recycled thousands of pounds of paper. But
            we’re just getting started. By partnering with local communities, libraries, and schools, we’re expanding
            our impact and helping to build a more sustainable future for the next generation.
